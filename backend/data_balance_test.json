Overall median survival </out> was 42 months . <out> Five-year actuarial survival </out> was 39.3 % ; 66.8 % in R0 resected patients and 22.3 % in patients treated without surgery or undergoing subtotal tumor removal . <out> Local control and disease-free survival </out> were significantly correlated with the interval between surgical treatment for primary tumor and local recurrence ( p = 0.028 and p = 0.003 , respectively ) . <int> Radical resection </int> significantly influenced <out> local control , disease-free survival , and overall survival </out> ( p = 0.010 , p = 0.010 , and p = 0.050 respectively ) .

RESULTS Regardless of type of food ( RHF or HE ) and time of day ( lunch or dinner ) , he <out> food portion size ( volume of food ) intake </out> was the same , approximately 80 % of the portions consumed . HE led to a 40 % increase in <out> energy intake </out> ( from 25 + /- 1 during RHF to 35 + /- 2 kcal/kg/d , p < .0001 ) , which result ed in a 3.4 % increase in <out> body weight </out> ( p < .001 ) after 3 weeks of HE . Only minimal changes in functional condition were found . The cost of HE was substantially lower ( -85 % ) than any other mean available for improvement of energy intake .

This is because a characteristic community of gut microbes seems to mediate some of the pathology . <int> <pop> Human gut microbes </int> </pop> can be transplanted effectively into <pop> germ-free mice </pop> to recapitulate their associated phenotypes .

Science , this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad3311 , p. 854 Microbes from healthy <pop> children protect mice </pop> from the detrimental <pop> effects </pop> of the <pop> microbiota of malnourished infants . </pop> INTRODUCTION As we come to appreciate how our microbial communities ( microbiota ) assemble following birth , there is an opportunity to determine how this facet of our developmental biology relates to the healthy or impaired growth of <pop> infants and children . </pop> Childhood undernutrition is a devastating global health problem whose long-term sequelae , including <out> stunting , neurodevelopmental abnormalities , and immune dysfunction </out> , remain largely refractory to current therapeutic interventions . RATIONALE To test the hypothesis that perturbations in the normal development of the gut microbiota are causally related to undernutrition , we first applied <int> r and om forests </int> ( RF ) , a machine learning method , to bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA data sets generated from fecal sample s that were collected serially from <pop> healthy Malawian infants and children </pop> during their first 3 postnatal years . Age-discriminatory bacterial taxa were identified with distinctive time-dependent changes in their relative abundances ; they were used to construct a sparse RF-derived model describing a program of normal postnatal gut microbiota development that is shared across biologically unrelated individuals . A metric based on this model <out> ( microbiota-for-age Z-score ) </out> was used to define the <out> state of development ( maturation ) of fecal microbiota </out> from <pop> infants and children </pop> with varying degrees of undernutrition . Fecal sample s obtained from <pop> 6- and 18-month-old children with healthy growth patterns or with varying degrees of undernutrition were transplanted into young germ-free mice that </pop> were <pop> fed </pop> a <pop> representative Malawian diet </pop> . The recipient animals \u2019 rate of lean body mass gain was characterized by serial quantitative magnetic resonance , their metabolic phenotypes were determined by targeted mass spectrometry , and their femoral bone morphologic features were delineated by microcomputed tomography . RESULTS <pop> Undernourished children in the Malawian birth cohort that </pop> we studied have <pop> immature gut microbiota </pop> . Unlike microbiota from healthy children , immature microbiota transmit <out> impaired growth , altered bone morphology , and metabolic abnormalities </out> in the muscle , liver , and brain to <pop> recipient gnotobiotic mice . </pop> The representation of several age-discriminatory taxa in the transplanted microbiota harbored by recipient animals correlated with their growth rates . Microbiota from <pop> 6-month-old infants </pop> produced greater <out> effects on growth </out> than did microbiota from <pop> 18-month-old children </pop> , although in each age bin , the growth <out> effects </out> produced by a healthy donor \u2019s community were greater than those produced by an undernourished donor \u2019s community . <int> Cohousing coprophagic mice </int> shortly after they received <int> microbiota </int> from <pop> healthy or severely stunted and underweight 6-month-old infants </pop> result ed in the invasion of age- and growth-discriminatory taxa from the former into the latter microbiota in the recipient animals , with associated prevention <out> of growth impairments . </out> Introducing cultured members from this group of invasive species ameliorated <out> growth and metabolic abnormalities </out> in recipients of microbiota from undernourished donors . CONCLUSION These pre clinical findings provide evidence that <out> gut microbiota immaturity </out> is causally related to <pop> childhood undernutrition . </pop> The age- and growth-discriminatory taxa that we identified should help direct studies of the effects of host and environmental factors on gut microbial community development , and they represent therapeutic targets for repairing or preventing gut microbiota immaturity .

DESIGN AND METHODS <pop> From 1972 to 1996 , the Department of Radiation Oncology and the Hematology Section of \" La Sapienza \" University of Rome observed </pop> and analyzed the occurrence of <pop> NHL in 1,391 patients treated for HD . </pop> The average follow-up period was 84 months . For a more accurate calculation of the risk of the <out> occurrence </out> of <out> NHL </out> , the patients were first divided into 3 groups according to their initial treatment and also according to the total <int> treatment </int> they had received . Then , in order to establish the possible connection between NHL and splenic treatment the patients were also divided into 3 subgroups according to whether they had undergone <int> splenectomy , splenic irradiation </int> or <int> neither of </int> these . Two different methods of statistical analysis were used : ( a ) the <out> cumulative risk ( confidence interval ) </out> was evaluated in relation to treatment ( initial and at the <int> time of salvage ) </int> and ( b ) the <out> Cox model </out> was applied to identify the variables which play a role in the appearance of NHL .
