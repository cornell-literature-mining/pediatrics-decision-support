Radiotherapy </int> was delivered to a planning target volume ( PTV2 ) including the gross tumor volume ( GTV ) plus a 4-cm margin , with a dose of 30 Gy ( 1.2 Gy twice daily with a minimum 6-h interval ) . A boost was delivered , with the same fractionation schedule , to a PTV1 including the GTV plus a 2-cm margin ( 10.8 Gy ) . During the <int> radiation treatment </int> , <int> concurrent chemotherapy </int> was delivered <int> ( 5-fluorouracil , protracted intravenous infusion </int> , 225 mg/m(2)/day , 7 days per week ) . Four to 6 weeks after the end of chemoradiation , patients were evaluated for <out> tumor resectability </out> , and , when feasible , surgical resection of recurrence was performed between 6 - 8 weeks from the end of chemoradiation . <int> Adjuvant chemotherapy </int> was prescribed to all patients , using Raltitrexed , 3 mg/square meter ( sm ) , every 3 weeks , for a total of 5 cycles . Patients were staged using the computed tomography (CT)-based F-classification ( F0 : no side-wall involvement ; F1 , F2 , F3 : 1 , 2 , and 3 - 4 side-walls involved , respectively ) . <out> Toxicity </out> was evaluated on the basis of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) criteria .

Surgical resection result ed as R0 and R1 in 21 patients ( 35.6 % ) and 3 patients ( 5.1 % ) , respectively . The possibility of radical resection was influenced by <out> tumor response </out> to chemoradiation ( PD/NC : 7/33 ; PR/CR : 14/26 ; p = 0.009 ) . Thirty-three patients received <int> adjuvant chemotherapy </int> , which was completed in 30 ( 50.8 % ) . At a median follow-up of 36 months ( range , 9 - 69 months ) , 28 patients ( 47.5 % ) developed <out> local recurrence or tumor progression </out> in the unresected pelvic disease and 18 patients ( 30.5 % ) developed <out> distant metastasis . </out> Seven patients showed <out> late toxicity </out> , including <out> 2 skin fibrosis , 2 impotence , 2 urinary complications requiring nephrostomy , and 1 small bowel fistula requiring surgical diversion . Overall median survival </out> was 42 months . <out> Five-year actuarial survival </out> was 39.3 % ; 66.8 % in R0 resected patients and 22.3 % in patients treated without surgery or undergoing subtotal tumor removal . <out> Local control and disease-free survival </out> were significantly correlated with the interval between surgical treatment for primary tumor and local recurrence ( p = 0.028 and p = 0.003 , respectively ) . <int> Radical resection </int> significantly influenced <out> local control , disease-free survival , and overall survival </out> ( p = 0.010 , p = 0.010 , and p = 0.050 respectively ) .

To determine the efficacy of 2 components of <int> musculoskeletal physiotherapy </int> on <pop> chronic low back disorder . </pop> Summary of Background Data . <int> Musculoskeletal physiotherapy </int> encompasses many treatment methods , however , <int> manual therapy </int> and <int> exercises to rehabilitate spinal stabilization </int> are the most frequently used . Despite their popularity , scant evidence supports their use on <pop> subjects with chronic low back disorder . </pop> Methods . <pop> A total of 346 subjects were r and omized to <int> manual </pop> therapy , a 10-week spinal stabilization rehabilitation program , or a minimal intervention control group . </int> Data were collected at baseline , and 3 , 6 , 12 , and 24 months after intervention . Outcome measures recorded <out> intensity of low back pain , disability , h and icap , medication , and quality of life . </out> There were 4 main variables combined in a primary component analysis to form a single outcome measure ( i.e. , a measure of dysfunction ) . Results . The results indicated statistically significant improvements in favor of the spinal stabilization group at the 6-month stage in <out> pain </out> ( 65.9 % reduction in symptoms ) <out> and dysfunction </out> ( combined mean reduction of 134 , st and ard error 23.84 ) , and at the 1-year stage in <out> medication </out> ( 34.3 % reduction in medication <out> ) , dysfunction </out> ( combined mean reduction of 134 , st and ard error 18.2 ) <out> , and disability </out> ( mean difference in change 15.71 Oswestry Disability Index , 95 % confidence interval 19.3\u201310.01 ) . Conclusions . As a component of musculoskeletal physiotherapy , the <int> spinal stabilization program </int> is more effective than manually applied therapy or an education booklet in treating chronic low back disorder over time . Both <int> manual therapy </int> and the <int> spinal stabilization program </int> are significantly effective in <out> pain reduction </out> in comparison to an active control . To our knowledge and up until now , this result has not been shown in patients with chronic low back disorder", "ABSTRACT : Small substrate stores and immature enzyme systems make <pop> preterm infants </pop> prone to develop hypoglycemia . <out> Hy-perglycemia </out> may also occur , particularly when these infants are given i.v . glucose . To evaluate the capacity for <out> regulation of glucose production </out> in response to glucose infusion , <pop> 10 newborn infants , born after 25\u201330 wk of gestation , </pop> were studied . Their <out> glucose production rates ( GPR ) </out> were calculated and <out> the concentrations of glucose , insulin , and glucagon in plasma </out> were measured during infusion of <int> glucose </int> at a rate of first 1.7 \u00b1 0.2 and then 6.5 \u00b1 0.3 mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121 ( 9.4 \u00b1 1.1 and 36.1 \u00b1 1.7 \u03bcmol\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121 ) ( mean \u00b1 SD ) . <out> GPR </out> was determined by use <int> of D-6,6\u20132H2 glucose . </int> When the <out> rate of infusion of glucose </out> was increased <out> , GPR </out> decreased from 4.3 \u00b1 1.3 to 1.4 \u00b1 1.1 mg-kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121 ( 23.9 \u00b1 7.2 to 7.8 \u00b1 6.1 \u03bcmol\u00b7kg\u2212l\u00b7min\u22121 ) ( mean \u00b1 SD ) ( p = 0.00006 ) . In addition , <out> the plasma insulin concentration </out> increased from 6\u00b12 to 11\u00b14 \u03bcU\u00b7mL ' ( p = 0.006 ) <out> and the plasma glucose concentration </out> from 3.6 \u00b1 1.1 to 6.1 \u00b1 1.3 mM ( mean \u00b1 SD ) ( p = 0.0002 ) , whereas <out> the </out> glucagon concentration remained unchanged . <out> only the insulin concentration in </out> plasma was significantly related to GPR . The results show that <pop> very immature newborn infants </pop> have an incomplete and varying capacity to <out> respond to glucose </out> infusion with suppression <out> of </out> glucose production . Insulin seems to be more important than <out> plasma glucose </out> in the regulation of glucose homeostasis in these infants", "A r and omized study was conducted to compare a generic and individualized approach to providing decisional support to <pop> men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer .

METHODS <pop> Two hundred eight practitioners in North Carolina were r and omly selected from six strata : urban primary care physicians ( n = 39 ) , rural primary care physicians ( n = 48 ) , urban <int> chiropractors </int> ( n = 32 ) , rural <int> chiropractors </int> ( n = 32 ) , <int> orthopedic surgeons </int> ( n = 29 ) , and <int> primary care providers at a group-model health maintenance organization </int> ( HMO ) ( n = 28 ) . </pop> The practitioners enrolled <pop> consecutive patients with acute low back pain . </pop> The patients were <int> contacted by telephone periodically for up to 24 weeks </int> to <out> assess functional status , work status , use of health care services , and satisfaction with the care received . </out> RESULTS The status at six months was ascertained for <pop> 1555 of the 1633 patients enrolled in the study ( 95 percent ) </pop> . The <out> times to functional recovery , return to work , and complete recovery from low back pain </out> were similar among patients seen by all six groups of practitioners , but there were marked differences in the use of health care services . The <out> mean total estimated outpatient charges </out> were highest for the patients seen by orthopedic surgeons and chiropractors and were lowest for the patients seen by HMO and primary care providers . <out> Satisfaction </out> was greatest among the patients who went to the chiropractors . CONCLUSIONS Among <pop> patients with acute low back pain </pop> , the outcomes are similar whether they receive care from primary care practitioners , chiropractors , or orthopedic surgeons . Primary care practitioners provide the least expensive care for acute low back pain", "Alcohol and benzodiazepines may increase <out> sleep-disordered breathing </out> by decreasing activity of pharyngeal dilating muscles , favoring the development of obstructive apneas and hypopneas . <int> Narcotics </int> cause greater depression of <out> wakeful respiration </out> than the previously mentioned drugs ; however , the influence of narcotics on the upper airway and breathing during sleep has not been studied . We , therefore , examined , in <pop> 12 healthy adults </pop> , the effects of <int> oral hydromorphone hydrochloride </int> ( 2 and 4 mg ) on <out> breathing during sleep </out> and on a variety of <out> awake respiratory variables ( minute ventilation , gas exchange , and chemoresponsiveness ) . </out> In addition , awake pharyngeal inspiratory airflow resistance was determined before and after narcotic administration to assess the drug 's influence on patency of the upper airway . Following both doses , <out> minute ventilation </out> decreased , and <out> carbon dioxide pressure </out> increased . The 4-mg dose of <int> hydromorphone hydrochloride </int> also produced a significant decrement in the <out> hypoxic ventilatory response </out> , whereas <out> hypercapnic responsiveness and pharyngeal resistance </out> did not change following either dose of the drug . Despite the <out> respiratory depression during wakefulness </out> described previously , no significant change was observed in any measure of <out> sleep-disordered breathing </out> after either dose of narcotic . We conclude that in <pop> healthy individuals without suspected sleep apnea </pop> , oral <int> hydromorphone </int> in st and ard dosages does not significantly increase <out> sleep-disordered breathing . </out> This result may be due to a lack of selective depression of upper-airway muscular function by the doses of narcotic used", "BACKGROUND Studies of <int> <pop> influenza vaccination </int> in healthy children </pop> have not definitely answered the question of their efficacy .

Design : This was a single-group , nonr and omized , quasi-experimental 8-week study . Sample / Setting : <pop> Ten BCSs with both sleep disturbances and hot flashes were referred to any of 4 Midwestern community acupuncturists . </pop> Methods : Assessment s were done at baseline ( weeks 1 , 2 ) , during treatment ( weeks 3 , 4 ) , and after treatment ( weeks 5 , 8) . <int> Acupuncture treatment </int> was tailored to the individual by community acupuncturists and provided as 3 sessions within a 2-week period ( weeks 3 , 4 ) .

The benefits of systemic <int> antibiotics </int> in these cases remains controversial and the use of intraperitoneal antibiotics has not been widely reported . At the <pop> Children 's Memorial Hospital </pop> we have carried out a double-blind controlled study of the effects of <int> intraperitoneal and wound irrigation </int> with <int> kanamycin </int> in cases of perforated appendicitis . METHODS <pop> Children with perforated appendicitis and established peritonitis undergoing operation from April 1969 to July 1974 were included in this study . </pop> Cultures of peritoneal fluid or pus were obtained on each patient . The use of systemic <int> antibiotics </int> and ~.eritoneal or wound drainage was left to the discretion of the surgeon . <int> Kanamycin and placebo </int> solutions were supplied in numerically coded vials , previously r and omized by Bristol Laboratories . These were added to identically coded 500 ml bottles of normal saline by the hospital pharmacy prior to use . Before closure of the peritoneum the peritoneal cavity and the wound were irrigated with either a <int> 0.25 % solution of kanamycin or with normal saline . </int> No attempt was made to suction all of the irrigant . A volume of 20 ml/kg of body weight was used up to a maximum of 500 ml . Irrigation with the <int> kanamycin </int> solution delivered 50 mg of drug/kg body weight . Each patient was specifically observed during the intraoperative and postoperative periods for <out> signs of respiratory depression . </out> None exhibited any sign of <out> depression or other evidence </out> of <out> drug toxicity . </out> The postoperative courses of <pop> 79 patients with perforated appendicitis were analyzed . This patient population included 37 boys and 42 girls . Nineteen were black , 59 white , and one oriental . Forty-eight per cent were between six and 10 yr of age ; 24 % were 13 mo to 5 yr ; and 28 % , 11 - 16 yr . <out> </pop> Wound infections </out> that necessitated the drainage of a primarily closed wound or prevented a planned delayed <out> primary closure </out> were distinguished from wounds showing only <out> prolonged or purulent drainage </out> at sites of peritoneal or wound drains . <out> Localized intra-abdominal abscesses </out> requiring operative drainage have been listed separately from presumed pelvic phlegmons that resolved spontaneously", "OBJECTIVES . Arachidonic acid ( 20:4n-6 ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( 22:6n-3 ) are essential for brain growth and cognitive development . We have reported that supplementing <pop> pregnant and lactating women </pop> with <int> n-3 very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids </int> promotes higher <out> IQ scores </out> at 4 years of age as compared with maternal supplementation with <int> n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids . </int> In our present study , <pop> the children were examined at 7 years of age </pop> with the same <out> cognitive tests </out> as at 4 years of <pop> age </pop> . We also examined the relation between plasma fatty acid pattern and BMI in children , because an association between arachidonic acid and adipose tissue size has been suggested . METHODS . The study was r and omized and double-blinded . The <pop> mothers </pop> took 10 <int> mL of cod liver oil or corn oil </int> from week 18 of pregnancy until 3 months after delivery . Their children were tested with the <out> Kaufman Assessment Battery </out> for Children at 7 years of age , and their height and weight were measured . RESULTS . We did not find any significant differences in <out> scores on the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children test </out> at 7 years of age between <pop> children whose mothers </pop> had taken <int> cod liver oil </int> ( n = 82 ) or <int> corn </int> oil ( n = 61 ) . We observed , however , that maternal plasma phospholipid <out> concentrations of \u03b1-linolenic acid ( 18:3n-3 ) and docosahexaenoic acid </out> during pregnancy were correlated to sequential processing at 7 years of age . We observed no correlation between <out> fatty acid status </out> at birth or during the first 3 months of life <out> and BMI </out> at 7 years of age . CONCLUSION . This study suggests that maternal concentration of n-3 very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids during pregnancy might be of importance for later cognitive function , such as sequential processing , although we observed no significant effect of n-3 <int> fatty acid </int> intervention <out> on global IQs . </out> Neonatal fatty acid status had no influence <out> on BMI </out> at 7 years of age", "Introduction : R and omised <int> controlled trials </int> ( <int> RCTs </int> ) are considered the least biased method for evaluating drug efficacy and several large long\u2010term <int> RCTs </int> in <pop> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease </pop> have been published .

Careful design processes are required to maximize adherence and minimize attrition . Objective This paper describes the development , implementation and use of a <int> Web-based intervention program design ed </int> to help <pop> those who have recently lost weight <out> sustain </out> their <out> weight loss </out> over 1 year </pop> . Methods The <int> weight loss maintenance website </int> was developed over a 1-year period by an interdisciplinary team of public health research ers , behavior change intervention experts , applications developers , and interface design ers . Key interactive features of the final site include social support , self-monitoring , written guidelines for diet and physical activity , links to appropriate websites , supportive tools for behavior change , check-in accountability , tailored reinforcement messages , and problem solving and relapse prevention training . The <int> weight loss maintenance program included a reminder system ( automated email and telephone messages ) that prompted participants to return to the </int> website if they missed their check-in date . If there was no log-in response to the email and <int> telephone automated </int> prompts , a staff member called the participant . We tracked the proportion of participants with at least one log-in per month , and analyzed log-ins as a result of automated prompts . Results <pop> The mean age of the 348 participants enrolled in an ongoing r and omized trial and assigned to use the website was 56 years ; 63 % were female , and 38 % were African American . </pop> While weight loss data will not be available until mid-2008 , <out> website use </out> remained high during the first year with over 80 % of the participants still using the website during month 12 . During the first 52 weeks , participants averaged 35 weeks with at least one log-in .

Comparison between groups showed that the group receiving <int> fluticasone propionate </int> had a lower % of <out> days with symptom-free exercise </out> at week 6 <int> ( fluticasone propionate </int> 87 % , <int> beclomethasone dipropionate </int> 81 % ) and % <out> days without rescue medication </out> at week 6 <int> ( fluticasone propionate </int> 87 % , <int> beclomethasone dipropionate </int> 80 % ) and over weeks 1 - 6 <int> ( fluticasone propionate </int> 80 % , <int> beclomethasone dipropionate </int> 73 % ) . Except for a higher <out> incidence of sore throat </out> in the <int> fluticasone propionate </int> group , the two treatments did not differ with regard to <out> safety </out> . There was no evidence of <out> adrenal suppression </out> with either treatment . In conclusion , <int> fluticasone propionate </int> 200 microgram daily ws at least as effective and as well <out> tolerated </out> as <int> beclomethasone dipropionate </int> 400 microgram daily in childhood asthma", "BACKGROUND Studies of <int> <pop> influenza vaccination </int> in healthy children </pop> have not definitely answered the question of their efficacy . METHODS We have carried out a r and omized trial in a <pop> well selected population of healthy preschool children in Sardinia , Italy . </pop> During <pop> October 1995 , 344 children aged 1 to 6 years , </pop> were <pop> r and omly assigned </pop> to receive <int> <pop> influenza vaccine </int> </pop> ( n=177 ) or <int> no treatment </int> ( n=167 ) . Two doses of a <int> trivalent subvirion vaccine , containing 15 mg of highly purified surface antigens from the component strains A/Johannesburg/33/94-like , A/Singapore/6/86-like and B/ Beijing/184/ 93-like </int> were administered . Follow-up data were collected from December 1 , 1995 through April 30 , 1996 . RESULTS <out> Seroconversion </out> was documented in 17 out of 17 children . No <out> specific systemic symptoms or severe local reactions </out> were observed after vaccination . Influenza-like episodes , defined by the <out> presence of fever and cough or sore throat </out> that <out> lasted at least </out> 72 hours , occurred in 63 ( 37.7 % ) of unvaccinated children and in 22 ( 12.4 % ) of vaccinated ones . The corresponding <out> reduction in disease incidence </out> was 67 % ( 95 % CI : 0.59 - 0.74 ) . Three episodes of <out> otitis </out> were observed among children in the control group versus zero among vaccinated children ( p=0.07 ) . <out> Mean duration of day care center absenteism </out> was significantly reduced by vaccination ( 2.3 days in unvaccinated and 0.5 day in vaccinated children , p<0.001 ) CONCLUSIONS <int> Influenza vaccine </int> is safe and effective in <pop> healthy preschool children . </pop> However the favourable implication s of vaccination on disease rate in subsequent years have to be evaluated"]
